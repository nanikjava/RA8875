When adding a new schematics symbol, please do the following:

1) Choose a unique name for the symbol. If the component is available
   in packages with different pin numbering schemes, you may want to 
   add number of pins or the package name to the symbol's base name,
   to make the name unique.

   If the package and the number of pins are not relevant for the
   schematics symbol, they should not be part of the name.

   Example: 74x1g08_5.lib

2) Create a .lib file containing just that symbol

3) Add a LibName# entry for it at the end of components.pro
   The LibName entry must have the form
   LibName#=./name.lib
   where # is the number of the highest-numbered entry, minus one

4) Record your authorship in ../AUTHORS
